# Multi-Capacity and Multi-Level Localization Project

## Overview

This project addresses the challenging problem of multi-capacity and multi-level localization by integrating two distinct models: the multi-capacity localization problem with a budget constraint and the localization problem with multiple levels of assignment and capacity constraints. The nature of this problem involves combinatorial analysis, a classic category in computer science and mathematics.

## Objective

The central objective of this project is to find the optimal configuration of locations for a set of elements, such as factories, while adhering to specific constraints. The problem holds significant importance in various domains, necessitating a systematic approach and powerful software tools for its solution.

## Key Features

- Integration of two distinct models: multi-capacity localization with a budget constraint and localization with multiple levels of assignment and capacity constraints.
- Combinatorial analysis to address the complexity of the problem.
- Identification of the optimal configuration of locations for a set of elements, respecting specific constraints.
